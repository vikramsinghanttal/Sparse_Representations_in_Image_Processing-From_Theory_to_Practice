% UNITARY_DICTIONARY_LEARNING Train a unitary dictionary via 
% Procrustes analysis.

% Inputs:
%   Y              - A matrix that contains the training patches 
%                    (as vectors) as its columns
%   D_init         - Initial UNITARY dictionary
%   num_iterations - Number of dictionary updates
%   pursuit_param  - The stopping criterion for the pursuit algorithm
%
% Outputs:
%   D          - The trained UNITARY dictionary
%   mean_error - A vector, containing the average representation error,
%                computed per iteration and averaged over the total 
%                training examples
%   mean_cardinality - A vector, containing the average number of nonzeros,
%                      computed per iteration and averaged over the total 
%                      training examples
